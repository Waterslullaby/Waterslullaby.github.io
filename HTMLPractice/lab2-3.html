                <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
                    <li>Program design focuses on breaking down the program into smaller, more managable components. Various tools are used to help design a program.</li>
                    <li>Commonly used tools:
                    
                        <ul style="list-style-type: circle">
                            <li>Structure Charts</li>
                            <li>Algorithm</li>
                            <li>Flow Charts</li>

                </ul>
            
            </li>
                
            <li>Code the program
            
                <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
                    <li>Once the program has been designed, a developer then writes the code.</li>
                    <li>Coding often involves translating the design from charts and pseudocode into a specific programming language. Usually the language is chosen during the "defining" stage.</li>
                </ul>
                
            </li>

                <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
                    <li>After code has been written this stage revolves around fixing any bugs in the program.</li>
                    <li>There are two kinds of errors that cause bugs:
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Syntax Errors: These are like grammatical mistakes in the code.</li>
                            <li>Logical Error: These mistakes might cause an other than intended output but the code still works.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>The programmer must fix these mistakes by carefully examining the already written code for errors.</li>
                </ul>
                
            </li>
            <li>Documentation
            
                <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
                    <li>After coding has been completed, the programmer must write a manual that generally contains the following:
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>An overview of the program's functionality.</li>
                        <li>In-depth explainations of program features.</li>
                        <li>Documentation of all commands.</li>
                        <li>A thorough description of error messages generated by the program.</li>
                    </ol>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
            </li>
            <li>Deploying and maintaining the program
            
                <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
                    <li>A software team will be responsible for fixing new errors and updating the software with new features.</li>
                    <li>When a new feature should be added to the program, the cycle restarts as developers begin to define what problems the new features will solve.</li>
                </ul>
                
            </li>
